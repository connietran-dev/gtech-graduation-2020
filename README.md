# Georgia Tech Bootcamp 2020 - Graduation Speech

#### *This is a speech I wrote for the Georgia Tech Full-Stack Web Development August 2020 graduating class.*

First, I am honored to be able to speak on this day at such a special event. Second, I want to thank Lauren, Barry, Jesse, Bernard, and of course, Stanley, for everything they have done for us during these last 6 months.

I’d like to take a moment to reflect on how far we’ve come. I think for most of us, this was not something we *had* to do like high school or college. This bootcamp was something we *chose* to do. But as Denzel Washington says: Nothing in life is worthwhile unless you take risks.

6 months ago, we started the prework. There was a video in it by James Clear on how to succeed in this course and build successful habits. In it, he talks about RESULTS - or WHAT you want to achieve versus your IDENTITY - or WHO you want to be.

So I wrote down the most important result I wanted to achieve in 6 months: I want to be able to code my own website from scratch that I’m proud of.

He also talked about creating identity-based goals rather than result-based goals. And he talked about *being* by *doing*. Every time you sit down to write, you are a writer. Every time you paint, you are an artist. 

So we wrote down “WHO is someone who will succeed in this course?”

We’ve been through so much since the prework. I remember going to class three times a week on the Georgia Tech campus and seeing you all in the classroom. Many of us work full-time, have our own families and busy personal lives. A few months ago, I would wish I had more time in my day to balance everything. And I’d be at work, wishing I could work remotely and just code all day.

There were times in this course when it was hard to juggle everything. I even wrote in April of this year - “I feel behind in my prework. I’m not yet good enough at coding. I don’t feel 100% confident in my coding or skills.”

Then COVID-19 happened. I remember when Bernard walked into class and told us that Georgia Tech was closing its campus. I was shocked, and honestly, scared. I wasn’t sure what was going to happen next.

At first, it was really hard to transition being online. We had to be home all the time, working in front of the computer for long hours, on top of balancing our personal lives during a global pandemic. Even the simple act of going to the grocery store turned into a big task. How were going to continue on in our course?

Now it’s August. Over the course of 6 months, this bootcamp has given me a sense of schedule during this pandemic. Sticking to a schedule and learning how to learn is something I hope to take forward as a habit for the rest of my life.

Before this course, I think many of us had dabbled in HTML and CSS. But then we took on the real challenge - we started learning Javascript. HTML and Javascript were invented in the 1990s and since then, we’ve learned an entire Javascript stack from Node to React.

In 6 months, we have essentially learned everything that has happened on the web in the last 20 years. We’ve learned so much in such a short time. So, I laugh at the goal I hoped to achieve 6 months ago, because we achieved that in the first few *weeks* of the bootcamp and have now learned so much beyond that.

And we learned it all despite a pandemic that has affected the entire world. If there is one thing we can thank COVID for, it is allowing us the time we had wished for. We have survived this pandemic, and we are stronger because of it.

Not only do we *know* of these concepts, we truly *understand* Javascript. And we have Stanley to thank for that. Thank you, Stanley, sharing decades of knowledge with us in these 6 months. You have helped us become software developers and because of that we are better people.

Before the bootcamp started, we were just trying to create successful habits. I ask you to look back on the person you thought you would become at the end of this bootcamp. Here are some of the things I wrote 6 months ago for the type of PERSON who makes a good developer: 

Someone who is motivated, highly disciplined. Someone who is a life-long learner. Always learning new technologies. Someone who DOES things, who actually codes, not just talks about it. Likes challenges. Solves problems. Educates and helps others. Someone who is not afraid of failure, or trashing bad code. Someone who is humble, willing to learn. Someone who is always trying to improve themselves.

At some point you are no longer trying to *change* your identity. You’re just acting in alignment with who you already are. At this point, it is no longer behavior change, you are just being the type of person you are. When I look back at the person I thought I would become, I have become that person. I have embodied those traits I hoped to achieve. I AM a software developer, because I have *become* that person *through doing*.

We are now part of a special group of creators in the world. Our job is *not* to code. It is to take dreams and turn them into reality. Completing this bootcamp is proof that you are capable of realizing our own dreams. It is proof that you are capable of learning something that you knew *nothing* about. You’ve proven that you can persist despite a pandemic that has affected the entire world, and you are stronger because of it. For me, this has been a dream for 8 years. I had only dreamed of learning the things we have learned. Today we have achieved that dream.

However, success is not *final*. Technology will always continue changing. We all know that. We have started what I hope is a long journey. Our mission now is to go deeper into our craft and continue to develop ourselves.

The person you were 6 months ago gave the person you are today, the gift of knowledge. So, I ask you to look back to where you were 6 months ago and challenge yourself to become a better person 6 months from now. We have learned how to code, but the *only* thing we walk away with today is ourselves. Remember, when you started, all you had was your passion. And we are already better than we were yesterday. Our mission now is to continue this journey.
