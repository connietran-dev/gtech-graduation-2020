# Georgia Tech Bootcamp 2020 - Graduation Speech

#### *This is a speech I wrote for the Georgia Tech Full-Stack Web Development August 2020 graduating class.*


First, I really am so honored to be able to speak at such a special event. Second, I want to thank Lauren, Barry, Jesse, Bernard, and of course, Stanley, for everything they have done for us during these last 6 months.

My experience during this bootcamp has been probably very similar for all of the students in the room. For me, my dream started 8 years ago when I graduated college and realized that I wanted more out of life. I would sit at my first job, staring at this ugly green old-school carpet in the office, daydreaming about learning how to code, and working at the Facebooks and Googles of the world. And for 8 years, I’d dream about being able to create something with my own hands, and I’d dream about being like the software developers I admired.

I think for most of us, this is not high school or college - this course was something we chose to do. But our favorite star says, Denzel Washington, said: “I’ve found that nothing in life is worthwhile unless you take risks.”

So, we signed up for the course, and we started learning HTML and CSS. I think many of us had dabbled in HTML and CSS before. Before the bootcamp, I’d dabble with some online courses in Python or even Javascript but have no context for anything I was doing. 

Then we started learning Javascript. On top of that, many of us work full-time, have families to take care of, and have our own personal lives. I remember going to class three times a week at Georgia Tech, wishing I had more time in my day. I remember wishing I could work remote and just code all day while I was at work.

Then COVID-19 happened. I remember when Bernard walked into class and told us that Georgia Tech was closing its campus, and I was shocked, and honestly, scared. I wasn’t sure what was going to happen next.

At first, it was really hard. We transitioned to being online, and it was hard to being at home all the time, working in front of the computer for long hours, on top of balancing our personal lives during a global pandemic. I wrote this in my journal in April of this year - “I’m not yet good enough at coding. I don’t feel 100% confident in my coding or skills. I feel behind in my prework.” And with the pandemic, I would plan my life, week to week - what I needed to do this week, and what I needed to do the next.

Now it’s August. 6 months ago, we started the prework. In the module for “How to Succeed in this Course”, there is a YouTube video by James Clear called “Successful Habits”. He talks about RESULTS - or WHAT you want to achieve and ACTIONS - what you have to do in order to have this result.

I journal a lot. Especially before big events in my life so I can reflect on my expectations and how they compare to my actual experience. My most important goal for this course - 6 months ago, before it even started: I want to be able to code my own website from scratch that I’m proud of. 

HTML was invented in 1993. In 1995, Javascript was invented and you could only use it progressively enhance HTML and CSS. Today, in 2020, Javascript is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. We have essentially learned everything that has happened on the web in the last 20 years. Today we learned stuff I only dreamed... So, after all of the initial chaos of COVID, if there is one thing we can thank COVID for, it is allowing us time to learn these concepts.

Not only do we *know* these concepts, we truly *understand* them. And we have Stanley to thank for that. Thank you, Stanley, for the gift of knowledge and sharing your decades of knowledge with us in these 6 months. You have helped us become software developers and because of that we are better people.

During the prework, we also talked about creating identity-based goals rather than result-based goals. And we talked about being *through* doing. Every time you sit down to write, you are a writer. Every time you paint, you are an artist. 

We asked ourselves “WHO is someone who will succeed in this course? What is the type of person who makes a good developer?” In my journal, 6 months ago, I wrote: 

Someone who is motivated, highly disciplined. Someone who is a life-long learner. Always learning new technologies. Someone who DOES things, who actually codes, not just talks about it. Likes challenges. Solves problems. Educates others. Someone who is not afraid of failure, or trashing bad code. Someone who is humble, willing to learn. Someone who is always trying to improve themselves.

This is something I wrote 6 months ago. In the video, he goes on to explain: 

Once you are no longer trying to change your identity, and you are just acting in alignment with who you already are, it is no longer behavior change, you are just being the type of person you are.

We have become part of a special group of people in the world who are creators. Our job is not to code, it is to take dreams and turn them into reality. This is only the beginning. Failure is not *fatal*, and success is not *final*. We have started what I hope is a long journey. Our mission now is to go deeper into our craft and continue to develop ourselves.

Technology will always continue changing. We all know that. But let this bootcamp always be testament that you are capable of turning dreams into a reality. It is proof learning something that you knew *nothing* about. And the possibility that is created when passion and persistence meet. When you started, all you had was your passion. You persisted in the face of a pandemic that has affected the entire world. And while we have learned how to code, the only thing we walk away with today is ourselves. And that is the greatest gift of all.


## My Personal Notes 

These were some bullets I made for myself when I first sat down to write this speech. #nojudgmentzone

**The Past**

* My emotional state 6 months ago:
    * Feeling down about where I was in my personal life
* This is a dream I have had for 8 years
* My most important goal: 
    * 6 months from now, I want to be able to code my own website from scratch that I am proud of.
* The type of person I want to be:
* Wishing I could work remote and code all day - I got my wish
COVID - At first things were really hard - I thought it’d last a few weeks, I’d go week by week...now it’s our graduation
* April - “I’m not yet good enough at coding. I don’t feel 100% confident in my coding or skills. I’m really sad that I probably picked the wrong year to do this bootcamp. I feel behind in my prework. When I think about it, it really makes me sad”
* In actuality, everything was an act of kindness toward my future self
* I've found that nothing in life is worthwhile unless you take risks - Denzel Washington

**The Present**

* This is a dream I have had for 8 years. Today I have achieved a life goal, achieved my dreams.
* James Clear - RESULTS (WHAT you want to achieve) | ACTIONS (what to do in order to have this result) | IDENTITY (who is the type of person who can achieve these results) -- Identity-based goals rather than result-based goals
* Who is someone who will succeed in this course: Someone who has good habits, motivated, highly disciplined, systemic with their habits.
* What is the type of person who makes a good developer?
    * Life-long learner. Always learning new technologies. Someone who DOES things, who actually codes, not just talk or thinks about it. Someone who works hard. Intelligent. LIkes challenges. Solves problem. Communicates. Helps others. Not afraid of failure, bad code. Someone who is humble, willing to learn. Someone who is always trying to improve themselves.
* Being through doing. Every time you sit down to write, you are a writer. Every time you paint you are an artist. When we had not yet become developers, the way to become one was to do it. And we have.
    * Once you are no longer trying to change your identity, and you are just acting in alignment with who you already are, it is no longer behavior change, you are just being the type of person you are. This is why it is the most important way to change habits. 
* The web has evolved from HTML in 1993 and CSS in the 90s - to React and Node today - we have learned everything that has occurred in the last 20 years of the internet in 6 months
    * What we have gained is not knowledge - it is a new evolved person
* Who I am now:
    * I’ve learned how to learn
* Imagine you got everything you wanted - this would make you weak.

**The Future**

* “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.” ― Winston S. Churchill
* “Try not to become a man of success. Rather become a man of value.” ― Albert Einstein
* “I’ve found that nothing in life is worthwhile unless you take risks. Fall forward. Every failed experiment is one step closer to success. You’ve got to take risks. You will fail at some point in your life. Accept it. You will lose. You will embarrass yourself. You will suck at something. There is no doubt about it. Never be discouraged. Never look back. Give everything you’ve got. And when you fall throughout life, fall forward.” - Denzel Washington
* “Nothing is as important as passion. No matter what you want to do with your life, be passionate. remember these three P’s: Passion + Persistence = Possibility.” - Jon Bon Jovi: Monmouth University, 2001
* We have become part of a special group in the world - we are creators
* This is only the beginning. We have started what I hope is a long journey. Our mission now is to go deeper into our journey and our craft
* Always look back at this time as proof you can do anything you put your mind to
